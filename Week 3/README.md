Plurality - A program that works as a system to determine the winning vote in elections. "In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election." - via CS50 website prompt for Plurality

Runoff - Instead of just the greatest number of votes, each voter casts their preferences from first to last. "The candidate who received the fewest number of votes is eliminated from the election, and anyone who originally chose that candidate as their first preference now has their second preference considered. Why do it this way? Effectively, this simulates what would have happened if the least popular candidate had not been in the election to begin with." - via CS50 website prompt for Runoff
