# CS50-Projects
This repo is for all the CS50 projects I have done, all the programs are organised and labelled.
The problem sets are the main assignments that are graded and checked. Labs are less difficult assignments that serve as a starter to the assignments of the corresponding weeks.

Files containing code will have their corresponding instructions, while files without extensions are executable machine code compiled from the source file.
